# cube

multi 3x3 coloured cube solver.


End goal is to make an interactive rubix cube which the user can enter their unsolved combonation and it will solve it and give the user a move combonation, sadly i dont know how to sovle a rubix cube... which makes it considerably harder to code it.

Any help is greatly aprecaited and needed. Thanks!
