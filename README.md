# Cube

Multi 3x3 coloured cube solver.


End goal is to make an interactive rubix cube which the user can enter their unsolved combination and it will solve it and give the user a move combinatio. This is 90% complete unfortunatly I don't atcually know how to sovle a rubix cube... which makes it considerably harder to code it, I still think it is a cool project which enabled me to inprove my programming abilty, and I would like to continue this project once I have learned how to solve a rubix cube

Any help is greatly aprecaited and needed. Thanks!
